    "# Example of Change Object Groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to present few example of `Change Object` Groups created by our algorithm on the article of `John Logie Baird`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " `Change Object:` consists of gaps of inserted and deleted string tokens which were either inserted or removed at contiguous positions. These gaps come between two revisions of an article.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These `Change Object` groups were created by clustering `Change Vectors` created from neighbour tokens equal to `context_length`. Clustering is done using DBSCAN which has two parameters `eps` and `min_sampels`. We evaluate the clusters using V-Measure analysis on human annotated data created to mark the tokens which were about nationality of John Logie Baird.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to identify the example of change object clusters which capture the nationality of *John Logie Baird* we use V-measure analysis to show the example of groups. As clusters are done using left and neighbour token Vectors we also show the left and neighbour context tokens along with gap of inserted and deleted tokens.  \n",

    "**Example of good and bad clusters**\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example is one which has almost similar tokens in left and right context. As the tokens in context start getting of different kind groups would not be about same gap."
